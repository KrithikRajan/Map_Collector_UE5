🎉 The wait is over! We are officially entering into Unreal Engine 5! 🎉🥳

🎯I have developed a map collector game in 🎮3D—a semi-top-down angle game using UE5 (Blueprint)📉. This game is very funny, and it is very easy to play.

🎯The game features vibrant graphics and engaging mechanics that keep players hooked. 

🎯Learnt the fundamentals of Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints📉. Code a small platformer game! It is available on Udemy. This course was taught by Moustafa Nafei - Pixel Helmet, this guy making Blueprint concepts for beginners in a very easy and understandable manner.😎


🎯I have learned things like,
 ➡ Variables—Python
 ➡ Get and set conditions
 ➡ Blueprint Fundamentals
 ➡ Events, Macros, and Functions
 ➡ Enumeration
 ➡ Blueprint Classes
 ➡ Execution Flow
 
🎯Game Logic:
 ⏩ This game is just about the movement of a Player(here sphere)⚽ through the map🗺 and we need to collect it and going up of the platform it will show us the final ranking💯 in trophy manner.

 🥉 When we collect between 0 -2, we will get Bronze Trophy.
 🥈 When we collect between 2 - 5, we will get Silver Trophy.
 🥇 When we collect Greater than 5, we will get Gold Trophy.

🎯Finally, I have created a game using these things with the guidance of the video lecture 🎮 . It was an incredible experience to see my ideas come to life on the screen😄. The combination of creativity and coding skills I developed throughout the course has motivated me to explore even more advanced game development techniques.💪

🎯Now, I am interested in learning C++ in Unreal Engine 5 for futuristic and advanced gaming development🕹. I believe that mastering C++ 💪 will allow me to take full advantage of Unreal Engine 5's capabilities and create even more complex and engaging gameplay experiences🤩. With the foundation I've built in Blueprint, I'm excited to see how I can integrate C++ into my projects to enhance performance and expand my creative possibilities.
